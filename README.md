In this project, I was responsible for writing the code that operates within the main loop of the application. Specifically, I created the logic that allowed the agent to choose between exploration and exploitation strategies. The base code provided the framework for the project, but the decision-making behavior was implemented by me.

Connecting Learning to Computer Science:
When approaching a problem as a computer scientist, I start by forming a hypothesis about how the system should work. From there, I develop an algorithm to test and refine that hypothesis, either proving it effective or identifying areas for improvement.

Regarding my ethical responsibilities, I believe transparency is critical, especially when working with machine learning. It's important to be upfront about the data sources used for training models and to actively identify and address potential biases to protect and fairly serve the end users and the organization.
